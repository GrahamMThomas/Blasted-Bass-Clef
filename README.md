# Blasted-Bass-Clef
I had been wanting to play the piano for a while however, I didn't know how to read bass clef! I had being playing trumpet for many years so treble clef wasn't an issue. There were a couple games online but nothing suited my fancy so I just built my own simple helper with Unity Game Engine.
